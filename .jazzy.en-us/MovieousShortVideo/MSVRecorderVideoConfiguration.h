This means that the order in which the frames will be emitted and stored (the decode order) will be different from the order in which they are presented to the video encoder (the display order). Encoding using frame reordering requires more system resources than encoding without frame reordering, so encoding performance should be taken into account when deciding whether to enable frame reordering.  This is especially important when encoding video data from a real-time source, such as AVCaptureVideoDataOutput.  In this situation, using a value of NO may yield the best results.
